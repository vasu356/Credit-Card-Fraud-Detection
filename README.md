Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced machine learning techniques. It combines data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling to create an effective pipeline for identifying fraudulent behavior in financial transactions.

Features
The workflow begins with data preprocessing, where the dataset is balanced by sampling non-fraudulent transactions and combining them with all fraudulent ones. The features are normalized to enhance model performance and consistency.

To better understand the dataset, visualization techniques such as Kernel PCA and t-SNE are applied. These methods help reveal patterns in the data and distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, making the data more interpretable.

The modeling phase leverages autoencoders for anomaly detection. These deep learning models are trained to reconstruct non-fraudulent transactions, enabling them to identify anomalies (fraudulent transactions) effectively. Hidden layer representations from the autoencoder are extracted as features, which are then classified using logistic regression for improved accuracy and robustness.

Results
This pipeline demonstrates the effectiveness of combining dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and machine learning classification for fraud detection. Models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy and classification reports, with comparisons made across various configurations of the autoencoder.

Technologies Used
This project uses Python for data analysis and modeling, with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data processing and visualization. Machine learning models and techniques are implemented using scikit-learn and TensorFlow/Keras. Dimensionality reduction methods such as Kernel PCA and t-SNE are employed to uncover insights from the dataset.

Dataset
The project uses the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains anonymized transaction features, including a highly imbalanced distribution of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
